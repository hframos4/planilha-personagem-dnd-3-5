<h1>Welcome</h1>
This is where I talk about this project. If you want a quick link, please see <a href="package/planilha.html">Spreadsheet</a>

<h1>Chrome app</h1>
This project is also present on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/planilha-de-personagem-dd/ijmoclncnlplomapiccaifhpjnolbfch">Chrome App Store</a>. Google will discontinue packaged apps in mid 2017, so I suggest to use the version on this page.

<h1>Source code</h1>
The code is open source and can be found on my github page: https://github.com/matferib/planilha-personagem-dnd-3-5. It is composed entirely by javascript and HTML, without any magic. In fact, I used this to learn javascript :)
